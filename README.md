## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt that structuring code is really important because later on it can get really difficult to make sense of everything if its not properly structured.

### Continued development

I would want to keep practising on these topics and also learn a framework simultaneously.
